## BrandView MVP Integration – Executive Overview
Prepared by: Adam Anderson, Chief Product Officer

### Objective
Integrate the BrandView MVP into our existing platform to enable brands and creators (influencers, musicians, athletes) to connect, collaborate, and track performance — without disrupting existing site functionality. All changes are gated by a feature flag for controlled rollout.

### 1) Core Changes to the Site
- **New Role-Based Portals**
  - **Creator Portal**: Connect social accounts, view performance metrics, get optimization guidance, access training modules.
  - **Brand Portal**: Search/filter creators, swipe to shortlist, view performance summaries, initiate chat placeholders.
- **Enhanced Onboarding Experience**
  - Guided, multi-step onboarding for both roles.
  - Collects role, profile info, niches, and social account links.
  - Immediate profile “health score” and improvement suggestions.
- **Front-Facing Analytics**
  - Pulls publicly available metrics (followers, engagement, posting frequency, watch-time if available).
  - Displays as easy-to-read cards and progress bars.
  - Brands see aggregated summaries; creators see full detail.
- **Matching & Shortlisting**
  - AI-lite matching based on niche overlap, profile health, and engagement scores.
  - Swipe-style interface for brand discovery.
  - Shortlist management tools for follow-up.
- **Education & Upskilling**
  - “Learn” section with training modules (articles, videos, checklists).
  - Suggestions in the dashboard link directly to relevant learning content.
- **Platform Connections**
  - Initial integrations: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Spotify, Snapchat.
  - Simple URL/handle connection; mock data if live API unavailable.

### 2) Technical Integration Approach
- **Feature Flag Control**: `BRANDVIEW_MVP` toggle ensures safe rollout with no disruption to current users.
- **Additive Data Models**: New tables for profiles, social links, metrics, and shortlists. No breaking schema changes.
- **Connector Registry**: Pluggable integrations for each social platform, with mock mode for demos and dev.
- **Versioned APIs**: New endpoints under `/api/brandview/v1/` for profiles, matches, metrics, and learning content.
- **UI Grafting**: Routes mounted at `/brandview/*` with consistent site navigation and theming.

### 3) User Experience Impact
- **Creators**
  - Streamlined onboarding, real-time metric insights, actionable guidance.
  - Pathway to improve skills and increase brand partnership opportunities.
- **Brands**
  - Efficient creator discovery and filtering.
  - Quick shortlist building with performance snapshots for better decision-making.
- **Overall**
  - Sticky, goal-oriented dashboards keep both roles engaged over time.

### 4) Rollout & Risk Management
- **Phased Release**: Dev → Staging (mock/live hybrid) → Limited Pilot → Public Launch.
- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Mock mode ensures demos even if APIs fail or rate limit.
  - Clear separation between public metrics and private analytics (Pulsemetric in Phase 2).
  - Feature flag allows instant rollback.

### 5) Strategic Value
- Positions platform as a trusted bridge between brands and creators with measurable outcomes.
- Differentiates through integrated training and performance scoring, not just matchmaking.
- Creates a scalable foundation for Phase 2 features (private insights, advanced AI recommendations, campaign management).

### Next Phase – MVP Data Tracker & Email Management System
- **Data Tracker (MVP)**
  - View normalized, real-time performance metrics across connected social platforms.
  - Track progress over time via stored metric snapshots.
  - Surface actionable suggestions to improve profile health and engagement.
  - Gated by `REACT_APP_BRANDVIEW_DATA_TRACKER_MVP`.
- **Email Management System (MVP)**
  - Build and send outreach campaigns directly from BrandView.
  - Track engagement (opens, clicks, replies) feeding analytics into the Data Tracker.
  - Manage contact lists and maintain compliance requirements.
  - Gated by `REACT_APP_BRANDVIEW_EMAIL_MVP`.

Both features integrate into the existing BrandView experience and operate behind feature flags for controlled rollout and testing.
